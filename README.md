# Dhwani🎵
## An Open Source CLI tool for a whole bunch of stuff..
Dhwani is a light-weight **NodeJs**-based CLI tool 🚀 with minimal dependencies, ease of use, and a whole lot more...

### Hey, why would I need it?
Well on serious note we don't know. But we created it with the purpose of offering the following features 🤗
1. Conversion from Video format to Audio Format.
2. Conversion from Audio format to Text Format.
3. Extraction of keywords from Text.

### Ok, what do I need to use it?
So, we didn't build it from scratch 😐. You need to have *NodeJS* to run this library 😅.  
Along with it, you also need [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) installed on you machine. We use it for video to audio conversion.  
Also, for other features we use *IBM Watson API.* You need to have your own API key to use these features.

### Alright I get that, but how do I install it?
Now you have [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Let's go ahead with the installation of **Dhwani**.  
A one-command installation can be done using the MAKEFILE in the project directory: 
```
make -f MAKEFILE
```
Otherwise, this manual approach can be used:
* `cd` into the project directory
* Run `npm install` to install all Node-based dependencies. Check *package.json* for more info.
* Run `npm link` to make **Dhwani** available globally on your machine.

#### Congratulations 👏 You can now use Dhwani!
Type `dhwani` into your command line to learn more!
